Apparel Export Data Collection and Analysis
Project Overview
This project implements a system to collect data from various sources (CSV files, APIs, and web scraping), cleanses the data, and stores it in a PostgreSQL database. The project focuses on gathering apparel export data, with the aim of analyzing the export trends of a specific country (e.g., Europe) and understanding the logistics involved in apparel exports.

Project Objectives
Data Collection: Extract data from CSV files, APIs, and web scraping.
Data Cleaning: Clean and preprocess data to ensure accuracy and completeness.
Database Storage: Store cleaned data into a structured PostgreSQL database.
Data Analysis: Integrate and query data for meaningful insights on apparel exports.
Technologies Used
Python: Used for data extraction, cleaning, and interaction with APIs.
Pandas: For data manipulation and cleaning.
BeautifulSoup: For web scraping.
Requests: To interact with APIs.
PostgreSQL: Used as the relational database to store the data.
SQLAlchemy: To interact with PostgreSQL using Python.
